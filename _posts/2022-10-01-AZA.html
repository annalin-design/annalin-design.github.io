description: The AZ Awards is a prestigious yearly event that honors excellence in global architecture and design. To build excitement around the gala, the team traditionally releases a one-minute promotional video each year. Previously, this task was managed by an external agency. With a passion for motion graphics, I took the initiative to propose creating the video in-house for the first time. The finished product was utilized across various marketing platforms, including Instagram, stories, and email campaigns. The team was thrilled with the outcome, and this successful approach was adopted for the following year as well.
