description: PC Express Rapid Delivery is a service that can bring groceries to your door in as little as 30 minutes. Working with the marketing manager and copywriter, I executed a holistic campaign aimed at driving brand awareness and recognition. The campaign strategy is to foster trial and repeat purchase behaviors through consistent and engaging communications. The final design showcases the speed and convenience of this service, talking to customers that has an immediate need for fresh grocery staples, pantry items and household supplies.
