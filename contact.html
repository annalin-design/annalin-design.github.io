<h1>Hello, I'm Anna, a designer based in Toronto, Canada.</h1>
<p>
    I am currently a designer at Manulife, where I contribute to advice marketing initiatives for Individual Insurance Canada. Previously, I worked at Loblaw Digital, focusing on design for PC Express.
</p><p>
    My expertise spans print and digital design, social media marketing, email and front-end development, visual identity, and illustration. I am committed to crafting work that connects with audiences, addresses their needs, and enhances brand value.
 </p><p>   
    Driven by a passion for continuous learning, I strive to expand my skill set beyond design. A holistic understanding of the entire process empowers me to create with intention and purpose.</p>
